stores the client in the global object, but only in development mode.

Actually we use global just as a storage.

During development in Next.js, your code gets reloaded frequently as you make changes. Without this line, each reload would create a new Prisma client and a new database connection. This could quickly lead to too many database connections, causing errors.

By storing the Prisma client on the global object, we ensure that even when your code reloads during development, it will reuse the existing Prisma client instead of creating a new one each time.
